# Movement-Dictionary-Maker-Web-App
This is a movement dictionary maker where you can record videos of yourself, save those videos under an upload name, and collect the videos in a movement dictionary folder. The web app also converts the videos to have a black background with the movement represented only by line-muscle landmarks.
